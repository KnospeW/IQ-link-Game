I submit the following for assessment as my best class.

* The serial method isPlacementValid()/updatePegsPiecePlacement()/getPegsForPiecePlacement() in class LinkGame
* Design for two different ways handling invalid placement(warning and snapHome)

I declare that this is entirely my own work, with the following documented exceptions:

* The idea of distinguish different pieces simply by its order(A,B,C,D...) comes from the test for task #6
* The idea of using array for the state of pegs comes from the discussion with Alex and Joel
