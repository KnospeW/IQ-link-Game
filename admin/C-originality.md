We declare that the work we have submitted for Stage C of this assignment and all stages before it is entirely our own work, with the following documented exceptions:

The idea of distinguish different pieces simply by its order(A,B,C,D...) comes from the test for task #6
The idea of judging off grid by juding the column and row whether they are neighbours comes from Steve in Boggle
